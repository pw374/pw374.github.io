<h1 id="Blog"> Blog</h1><p>
I&#39;m trying to make this website my new blog, using OMD and MPP, 
with OCaml of course, but also the (awful) HTML/CSS/JS triplet.</p>
<p>Here follow the latest blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="OMDaMarkdownparserinOCaml"> OMD: a Markdown parser in OCaml</h2>
<h3 id="Motivations"> Motivations</h3>
<p>There  are  so many  existing  implementations  of  Markdown, why  yet
another one?   Well, after asking  the OCaml community  about existing
ways to parse and manipulate  Markdown documents, it seemed that there
were no stand-alone complete Markdown parser written in OCaml, meaning
that they  were incomplete (i.e., not fully  compatible with Markdown)
or  interfaces  to  some  Markdown  parsers  implemented  using  other
languages than OCaml.</p>
<p>Since in OCaml  Labs we&#39;re working a lot with  Github, and Github uses
Markdown a  lot (Github  web pages hosting,  Github issues,  etc.) and
other  sites are also  using Markdown  as well,  and Markdown  is very
popular and  easy to  learn, and  flexible in the  sense that  you can
always  fall back  to HTML  when you  want to  express  something that
doesn&#39;t have  a special syntax in  Markdown, blah blah blah,  it was -
somehow - time to have  a Markdown parser implemented using OCaml. And
preferably  OCaml alone,  meaning that  one that  has  OCaml installed
should be able  to use it easily without having to  deal with too many
dependencies. Well, there it is: OMD!</p>
<h3 id="IssueswereessentiallywithMarkdownitself"> Issues... were essentially with Markdown itself</h3>
<p>Every computer  scientist knows how to  write a parser  for a language
that is as simple as Markdown. Well, no, not every computer scientist,
sadly, but at least every programmer should. Ok, sadly it isn&#39;t really
the case either. Anyways.</p>
<p>Markdown is a rather simple language,  if you look at the specs. Well,
that depends on what you actuall call &quot;specs&quot;, of course. According to
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdow'>Wikipedia</a>,     Markdown    was
invented by <a href='http://daringfireball.net'>John Gruber</a>, and Aaron Swartz
helped  him. Then the  original document  that describes  the Markdown
language          is          available         online          there:
<a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax'>http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax</a>.  And you can see
that         searching        for         <a href='https://www.google.com/#q=Markdown+syntax'>&quot;Markdown+syntax&quot;        on
Google</a> makes that page the
top result (and here again, I&#39;m kind  of helping it be and stay on the
top...).</p>
<p>Actually, Markdown is not that  simple to parse.  Why? Because so many
things are  just left to the  imagination of the  people who implement
parsers  for  this  language,   because  programmes  can&#39;t  decide  by
themselves  what&#39;s right  to do.   It&#39;s  really the  author(s) of  the
programme that  decides what the  programme does. And in  Markdown, so
many  things  are ambiguous  and  Gruber&#39;s  document doesn&#39;t  actually
describe a  grammar at all.  It just tells  you how to write  this and
that, but if you write it slightly differently, it doesn&#39;t tell you
what the outcome would be. 
<em><strong>In other words, there are no errors in Markdown.</strong></em>
Every text file is a valid Markdown file, it might just be converted 
to some HTML you wouldn&#39;t expect. For instance, you may write a link 
using this  syntax:</p>
<pre><code>[blah blah blah](the-url-which-can-be-absolute-or-relative)
</code></pre>
<p>and it gets converted to</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;the-url-which-can-be-absolute-or-relative&quot;&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
But if you forget the closing parenthesis, then it becomes this instead</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;[blah blah blah](the-url-which-can-be-absolute-or-relative&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
precisely because nothing is wrong in Markdown.</p>
<p>And what if there are parentheses in your URL? What if they are unbalanced?</p>
<h4 id="FlagrantAmbiguity"> Flagrant Ambiguity</h4>
<p>The following is some text that has to mean something in Markdown...</p>
<pre><code>* Alice is falling in love with Bob.
    * Bob is secretly in love with Alice, but he&#39;s seeing Eve.
  * Eve is in-between, she loves both Alice and Bob, she can&#39;t help it.
</code></pre>
<p>So, Pandoc, which a tool that converts a document in language A to a
document in language B, where A and B can be the same or different
languages amongst LaTeX, HTML, Markdown and (many) others, considers
that Eve is on the same level as Bob. So its HTML output is</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice is falling in love with Bob.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob is secretly in love with Alice, but he&#39;s seeing Eve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eve is in-between, she loves both Alice and Bob, she can&#39;t help it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But if instead you add Dylan as in</p>
<pre><code>* Alice is falling in love with Bob.
   * Dylan, a new character, is being conceived here.
    * Bob is secretly in love with Alice, but he&#39;s seeing Eve.
  * Eve is in-between, she loves both Alice and Bob, she can&#39;t help it.
</code></pre>
<p>then <em>of course</em> Eve is not on the same level as Bob anymore and goes
with Dylan and Alice, Bob is on his own.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice is falling in love with Bob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dylan, a new character, is being conceived here.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bob is secretly in love with Alice, but he&#39;s seeing Eve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eve is in-between, she loves both Alice and Bob, she can&#39;t help it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn&#39;t make much sense...</p>
<p>And Github&#39;s embedded Markdown  to HTML converter chooses some similar
broken semantics. If one writes bullets on different levels, it shouldn&#39;t
be meaningless.</p>
<p>Also, on Github, if you write</p>
<pre><code>* 1
  * 2
    * 3
      * 4
        * 5
          * 6
            * 7
              * 8
                * 9
                  * 10
</code></pre>
<p>Then 2 and 3 are on the same level, as for 4 and 5, 6 and 7, and 8 and 9.
1 and 10 are on their own. And if you extract 2 and 3, meaning</p>
<pre><code>  * 2
    * 3
</code></pre>
<p>
then 2 and 3 are not on the same level anymore! 
See for yourself:</p>
<ul>
 <li>raw version: <a href='https://raw.github.com/pw374/sandbox/master/mad-lists.md'>https://raw.github.com/pw374/sandbox/master/mad-lists.md</a>
 </li>
 <li>rendered-by-Github version: <a href='https://github.com/pw374/sandbox/blob/master/mad-lists.md'>https://github.com/pw374/sandbox/blob/master/mad-lists.md</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With OMD, hopefully, there is a deterministic meaning for each level of indentation. The list where there were Alice, Bob and Eve is converted to this to the least insane semantics I could think of.</p>
<p>The idea  is that, since Eve  is neither on  the same level as  Bob or
Alice, Eve should be in a new list (because, obviously, she&#39;s the only
one on that  level anyway). So she  is in a new list.  And since she&#39;s
not on a deeper level than Bob, she shouldn&#39;t be on a sub-list of his.
But  she is  on a  deeper level  than Alice,  so she  has to  be  on a
sub-list of hers. So, here is the HTML that OMD produces:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Alice is falling in love with Bob.
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Bob is secretly in love with Alice, but he&amp;apos;s seeing Eve.
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Eve is in-between, she loves both Alice and Bob, she can&amp;apos;t help it.
   &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Oh,  you might  have  noticed  that OMD  converts  quotes to  <code>&amp;apos;</code>
because otherwise I  would need to differentiate when  they have to be
converted from when it&#39;s optional.</p>
<h3 id="Implementation"> Implementation</h3>
<p>Pandoc&#39;s documentation says</p>
<blockquote><p>
In contrast to most existing tools for converting markdown to HTML,
which use regex substitutions, Pandoc has a modular design: it
consists of a set of readers, which parse text in a given format and
produce a native representation of the document, and a set of writers,
which convert this native representation into a target format.
Thus, adding an input or output format requires only adding a reader
or writer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come on,  most tools are using regular  expressions substitutions?!  I
can only imagine the nightmare that  it must be to implement and debug
such an implementation  -- no wait, I can&#39;t because  I just don&#39;t want
to imagine such a nightmare.</p>
<p>I used functions and function calls, a lot of them are tail recursive,
not  all of  them but  then it  means  I don&#39;t  need them  to be  tail
recursive, and  those functions  basically take a  list of  tokens and
return a  new list  with possibly fewer  tokens and the  expression to
which the missing ones were converted into.</p>
<p>So far, in version 0.4 (which is  not released yet at the time I write
this), there&#39;s a little less than  8k lines of pure OCaml code.  (Note
that I didn&#39;t write &quot;pure functional&quot;, I wrote &quot;pure OCaml&quot;.)</p>
<p>OMD is an  open-source free and libre software  library that any OCaml
developer can use  (hopefully quite easily since it  doesn&#39;t depend on
anything else  that the standard  OCaml compiler and library).  And of
course, it&#39;s also  a tool for any one who write  Markdown and wants it
to be  converted (quickly)  to HTML.  OMD, so far,  is about  10 times
faster than  Pandoc, and  I didn&#39;t  even make any  efforts to  make it
fast.</p>
<h4 id="Compatibility"> Compatibility</h4>
<p>OMD has been developed using OCaml 4.0.1, <a href='https://github.com/pw374/omd/issues/19'>Christophe Troestler made
me make it compatible with OCaml
3.12.1</a>.  Then I guess it
might work with older version of OCaml but it&#39;s not certain (mainly
because OCaml&#39;s standard library has slightly changed, as I think I
don&#39;t use any language features that were introduced in 3.12 or 4.0).</p>
<p>By  the way,  thank  you  Christophe for  your  support, interest  and
contributions to OMD :-)</p>
<h3 id="FutureofOMD"> Future of OMD</h3>
<p>OMD  already is  in OPAM.   A  very stable  version of  OMD should  be
released soon.   As a  tool, it takes  Markdown as input  and produces
HTML as output.   A Markdown backend has been  freshly implemented, so
you can output  Markdown as well, which is  quite useful for debugging
or if you  want to know how many iterations you  need before you reach
the fix  point. You  can also  output &quot;text&quot;, in  the sense  that it&#39;s
basically the HTML  without the HTML tags, so  it&#39;s very non-formatted
text.  There  also are  options to output  HTML table of  contents and
parametrise their depths.</p>
<h3 id="OMDandOCamlorg"> OMD and OCaml.org</h3>
<p>We    are    at   OCaml    Labs    making    a    new   website    for
<a href='http://ocaml.org'>ocaml.org</a>.   The  design   is  being  provided  by
<a href='http://www.onespacemedia.com'>onespacemedia</a>.    At   the  time   I&#39;m
writing  these  lines, I&#39;m  using  the  HTML/CSS/JS  for the  upcoming
OCaml.org to style my new Github-hosted website, so I can play with it
<em>more</em>.</p>
<p>Most pages will be written in Markdown instead of HTML, so that people
of the OCaml community may contribute to it in a more convenient way.</p>
<p>And of course, that means that OMD will be used for OCaml.org.</p>
<h2 id="OPAMDOCwithmultipleOCamlpackages"> OPAM-DOC with multiple OCaml packages</h2><h3 id="OPAMDOC"> <a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/'>OPAM-DOC</a></h3>
<p>The tool <code>ocamldoc</code> shipped with the standard distribution of the
OCaml compiler suffers from some limitations because it doesn&#39;t have
access to all the information it needs. Notably, if you want to build
the documentation of some package <code>a</code> that depends on some package
<code>b</code>, you&#39;ll find out that the documentation of the package <code>a</code> will
not automatically refer to the documentation of the package <code>b</code>.
Well, opamdoc solves this problem and it&#39;s very nice.</p>
<p>On <a href='http://ocaml-redesign.github.io/'>this site</a>, which is work in progress,
you can find a <a href='http://ocaml-redesign.github.io/pkg/'>list of packages</a> 
with their descriptions. This list is built using <a href='https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam2web'>opam2web</a>.
And each package description links to its documentation. And the documentation
for all packages is built as a whole, which means that if the documentation of 
a package links to all other packages on which it depends. Isn&#39;t it nice? 
:)</p>
<h3 id="Installandrunopamdoc"> Install and run opamdoc</h3>
<p>opamdoc is still under active development, the current step is
<a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/issues/'>finding and fixing remaining issues</a> and
packaging.</p>
<p>If you want to use opamdoc now, here&#39;s some instructions based on
<a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/issues/1#issuecomment-23430108'>Anil&#39;s instructions</a>, 
which are those:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>opam remote add opamdoc git://github.com/avsm/opamdoc-dev
opam switch 4.01.0beta1+opamdoc
eval `opam config env`
opam install opamdoc
opamdoc-rebuild
opamdoc-generate
open ~/.opam/4.01.0beta1+opamdoc/opamhtml/index.html
</code></pre>
<ul>
 <li><code>opamdoc-rebuild</code> builds a database of cmt/cmd files in <code>~/.opam/4.01.0beta1+opamdoc/opamdoc</code>.
 </li>
 <li><code>opamdoc-generate</code> builds a package HTML list in <code>~/.opam/4.01.0beta+opamdoc/opamhtml</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, they work quite well, except <code>opamdoc-rebuild</code> uses <code>.cmd</code>  files as a base, whereas
it should use <code>.cmt</code> files instead because sometimes <code>.cmt</code> files exist while <code>.cmd</code> don&#39;t.
This is a problem for a few packages (<code>Core</code> is one of them).</p>
<p>My advice: if something doesn&#39;t work as expect, 
please <a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/issues'>open an issue</a>, 
and if you want to customize the way the documentation is built, 
don&#39;t hesitate to edit <code>opamdoc-rebuild</code> and/or <code>opamdoc-generate</code> (they are Bash scripts).</p>
<h4 id="Afewnotesaboutthoseinstructions"> A few notes about those instructions</h4>
<p>The first line, which is <code>opam remote add opamdoc git://github.com/avsm/opamdoc-dev</code>, 
will give sense to the second one, which is <code>opam switch 4.01.0beta1+opamdoc</code>.
And <code>4.01.0beta1+opamdoc</code> is a customised compiler that produces on the side the <code>.cm{t,d}{,i}</code> files
that are used by opamdoc. Using it is very convenient! If you don&#39;t use it, you need to produce
those files in an other way <strong>of your choice</strong> (really? you want to go through such trouble?).</p>
<p>Note that opamdoc is written in such  a way that it would ask a lot of
work to  make it work  with versions of  the compiler prior  to 4.01.0
because it uses features introduced by this very version.</p>
<p>Just in case, here follow the customised version of <code>opamdoc-rebuild</code> and <code>opamdoc-generate</code> that 
I used to build the documentation available on <a href='http://ocaml-redesign.github.io/pkg/docs/'>http://ocaml-redesign.github.io/pkg/docs/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ontheImplementationofOPAMDOC"> on the Implementation of OPAMDOC</h2><p>
<a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/commits/master'>Early this year, Leo White started the implementation of
opamdoc</a>.
Then <a href='https://github.com/vincent-botbol'>Vincent Botbol</a> worked on it
from late May to mid August during his stay in Cambridge.</p>
<p>Now, Vincent&#39;s back to studying &quot;computer science research&quot; in Paris,
and he continues working on opam-doc when he can on his free time.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t really want to get involved too deep in the implementation of
opamdoc (mainly  because it takes time). Eventually,  since I&#39;ve ended
up        doing        most        of       the        <a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org'>technical-side
implementation</a> of the
<a href='http://ocaml-redesign.github.io'>new  ocaml.org web  site</a>, I  had to
eventually get into  opamdoc&#39;s source code to integrate  its output in
the website.</p>
<p>If you look at the <a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/'>source code of
opamdoc</a>, you&#39;ll see there&#39;s a
bunch of files at the root directory. Well, some of them are inherited
from the implementation of ocamldoc, and some are new.  I&#39;ve mostly
contributed to
<a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/blob/master/generate.ml'><code>generate.ml</code></a>
and
<a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/blob/master/opam_doc_config.ml'><code>opam_doc_config.ml</code></a>.
The former implements the HTML backend of opamdoc, and the latter
contains the JavaScript engine that loads the documentation. This blog
post is mostly about my experience with those two files.</p>
<h3 id="generateml"> generate.ml</h3>
<p>This big file (about 1.5 kloc) contains the functions to retrieve
the information from cmt, cmd, cmti, cmdi and cmi files in order to
build the HTML document.</p>
<p>Side note:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The <a href='http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2012/08/20/ocamlpro-and-4.00.0.html'><code>.cmt</code> files were officially introduced in the standard OCaml
compiler in version
4.00.0</a>,
so it&#39;s pretty recent work. Previously, they were produced by a
separate tool developed at OCamlPro for
<a href='http://www.typerex.org'>TypeRex</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="Tworeasonswhyit39snotsupereasy"> Two reasons why it&#39;s not super easy</h4>
<p>Well, this  can actually  be explain  in just a  few words.   To begin
with, there  are many cases to  address. Well, that is  not <em>exact</em>. I
should say that  there are may cases to address  <em>and</em> those cases are
fairly <strong>poorly  documented</strong>, which is &quot;normal&quot; given  that there was
probably no  particular motivation to put  efforts into documentation.
This is  true for the source  code of ocamldoc <em>and</em>  for its official
documentation.</p>
<p>For instance, if you look into
<a href='https://github.com/ocamllabs/opam-doc/blob/master/info.mli'><code>info.mli</code></a>, you
can see that the first type definition is:</p>
<pre><code class='ocaml'><span class='k'>type</span> style_kind <span class='k'>=</span>
  <span class='o'>|</span> SK_bold
  <span class='o'>|</span> SK_italic
  <span class='o'>|</span> SK_emphasize
  <span class='o'>|</span> SK_center
  <span class='o'>|</span> SK_left
  <span class='o'>|</span> SK_right
  <span class='o'>|</span> SK_superscript
  <span class='o'>|</span> SK_subscript
  <span class='o'>|</span> SK_custom <span class='k'>of</span> string
</code></pre>
<p>and the only documentation for this type is
<code>(** The differents kinds of style.  *)</code>.
Well, you can see that there&#39;s not really any
documentation needed for those <code>SK_...</code> until... you see
<code>SK_custom of string</code>.  There you go! You have to guess...</p>
<p>It&#39;s not that hard when you have to guess a few times, it&#39;s
a lot harder when you keep having to guess. That&#39;s my point.</p>
<p>Well, the other issue is more interesting.  At the time <code>ocamldoc</code> was
designed  and  implemented,  I  bet  no one  imagined  what  folks  at
JaneStreet would do with  OCaml!  I&#39;m talking about the implementation
of their  open source library, known  as <code>Core</code>.  &quot;<code>Core</code> &amp;  co&quot; use a
<em><strong>lot</strong></em> of  <code>include</code> directives.  The module  <code>Core.Std</code> includes a
lot  of other  modules, which  also include  modules. If  you  want to
generate a single  full HTML page for <code>Core.Std</code>, you&#39;d  end up with a
<em><strong>huge</strong></em> page.  And  such a page would contain  a lot of information
coming straight  from other  pages, so you&#39;d  end up with  hundreds of
megabytes.  Instead of  doing so, opamdoc generates only  one page per
package and one per module. If a module includes another one, then the
first will fetch the documentation of the second and there you go.  So
we  only  have 8.4MB  of  HTML  for  {async, async_core,  async_extra,
async_unix,  core, core_bench,  core_extended,  core_kernel} in  total
(well, this  number should  increase in the  future, but  linearly, as
people  will hopefully  start  documenting all  those packages).   And
that&#39;s why we have a JavaScript loader.</p>
<h3 id="opamdocconfigmlordocsloaderjs"> opam_doc_config.ml, or docs_loader.js</h3>
<p>Since the JavaScript  may have to load tens of  megabytes of HTML, you
have to program some nasty functions and loops... and at some point it
does become big enough for  your browser to stop responding while it&#39;s
busy  loading your documentation.  So there  are several  solutions to
that. The best would probably be to stop writing in JavaScript (and
use something else that compiles to JavaScript). But that&#39;s for next
step. Now, we&#39;re trying to make the JavaScript work.</p>
<p>The problem  with JavaScript  is that basically  there is  one &quot;event&quot;
loop,  and  all events  are  happening  sequentially or  concurrently,
depending on how  you wrote your JS, but when one  event is making the
browser busy,  the browser is unable  to do anything  else. That&#39;s why
your browser may tell you at  some point that you have a script making
it ill and ask you whether  you want it to stop executing that script.
One workaround  for that problem  when you know  you ask for a  lot of
computation time is to divide  your big computation into smaller ones.
You can  use <code>window.setTimeout</code> for that, meaning  you transform your
recursive calls like <code>f()</code>  into <code>window.setTimeout(f, 0)</code> so that <code>f</code>
will be called at some point. And if you have iterative loops instead,
write them recursive and use <code>window.setTimeout</code>. That&#39;s bad.  Because
then the browser  is unable to tell that it&#39;s  crazy busy...  and it&#39;s
still really busy. So you can increase the value 0 to 1 or 10 or more.
But if you increase it too much, it&#39;ll become too slow...</p>
<p>Ok, well, don&#39;t use JavaScript. It&#39;s a nightmare.</p>
<p>We will probably rewrite the script using Js_of_ocaml at some point,
mainly because when you write in OCaml, you have static type checking,
and that saves so much time!</p>
<p>To be followed...</p>
