I&#39;ve been &quot;playing&quot; with COB LEDs for about half a year now. Here&#39;s a 
summary of my experience.</p>
<h3 id="Preliminaries"> Preliminaries</h3>
<h4 id="COBLEDs"> COB LEDs</h4>
<p>A  &quot;COB LED&quot; is a  basically a bunch of tiny  LEDs put on
together to  provide a very  energy-efficient and usually  very bright
LED (using  both parallel  and series circuit  schemes). Note  that it
means the  voltage of COB LEDs  are not the voltage  of &quot;normal LEDs&quot;,
since putting some LEDs in series means adding up voltage values!</p>
<h4 id="AnLEDdoesnotbehavelikeanincandescentlightbulb"> An LED does not behave like an incandescent light bulb</h4>
<p>Also,  note that  if there&#39;s  a roughly  linear relation
between light  intensity and voltage  for classic lamps, it&#39;s  not the
case  at all  with LEDs!  With  LEDs, basically,  the light  intensity
varies with the amperage, not the voltage. So if you lower the voltage
by a  very little bit, it will  shine as bright if  the amperage keeps
up; if  you lower  the voltage too  much, it basically  stops emitting
light (e.g.,  if you give  it 16V instead  of 19V, you have  so little
light that it&#39;s  really useless), but if you  increase the voltage too
much you still fry your LEDs so you don&#39;t want to do that at all.</p>
<h4 id="LightcolorsmeasuredinKelvin"> Light colors, measured in Kelvin</h4>
<p>Basically,  2700K  to   3300K  correspond  to  classic  (discontinued)
incandescent  light bulbs,  and  it&#39;s quite  close  to classic  candle
light, which  is about  1850K.  6500K  is day light  as in  &quot;the light
provided by the Sun on a sunny  day at noon&quot;, which seems very cool if
it&#39;s  dark outside or  if you  have warm  light around.   My favourite
artificial light color  is generally from 4000K to  5000K.  I find the
3000K quite  acceptable, below  that is too  warm, above 6000K  is too
cool.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t  get  me  wrong:  in  this  post, &quot;cool&quot;  not  a  synonym  for
&quot;awesome&quot;, stick to its original meaning instead.</strong></p>
<p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature#Categorizing_different_lighting'>Read more on Wikipedia.</a></p>
<h4 id="Colorspectraldistribution"> Color spectral distribution</h4>
<p>Note  that LEDs  generally have  a very  narrow light  color spectrum.
That  means that  instead  of emitting  light  of a  lot of  different
colors, including  some colors  you don&#39;t see  or colors that  are not
very much noticed because they are less intensively emitted, LEDs will
really emitt  just the color  you asked for.  That is not such  a good
thing (it&#39;s not  so bad either). But as a  consequence, you might feel
that the light  emitted by an LED is not very  comfortable.  What I do
is that I mainly  use warm light LEDs and I add  a few cool light LEDs
amongst them: it goes  from 1 cool for 6 warms to  1 for 1. The result
of 1  for 1 is quite  nice when it&#39;s  bright outside, but it&#39;s  not so
nice if it&#39;s in the middle of the night.</p>

<h3 id="Whynotsimplybuynormallamps"> Why not simply buy normal lamps?</h3>
<p>Well, buying new  lamps for having more light  implicates buying light
bulbs as  well. I&#39;m  not a very  big fan  of light bulbs  that contain
mercury  because if  you ever  break one,  you&#39;ll breathe  mercury gas
(much likely in  small quantities though). And I  can&#39;t install lights
on the wall  without asking my landlady for permission,  and even if I
did have permission,  it would mean putting electric  wires inside the
wall and that&#39;s not really an  idea that speaks to me (I&#39;ve never done
that) and  that means painting the  wall afterwards (not a  big fan of
painting walls either). What about  LEDs then? Don&#39;t I need to install
them on the wall  anyway? Well, no, I don&#39;t! I have  access to some of
the iron  based framework, and  as LEDs are  light weight and  flat, I
stick them  on some material  on which I  put some magnets,  et voilà!
(Now I&#39;m even a bigger fan of strong magnets than before.)</p>
<p>Well, I  won&#39;t deny it, the  main reason why  I wanted to use  LEDs is
that   it&#39;s   super  high   tech,   it&#39;s   fun,   it&#39;s  powerful   and
energy-efficient (and  ecological), it&#39;s  nice, it&#39;s the  future, it&#39;s
geek. Also, we plan on using LEDs massively in university of Cambridge
buildings, starting with the department of computer science.</p>
<h3 id="WhatI39veused"> What I&#39;ve used</h3>
<h4 id="LEDs"> LEDs</h4>
<p>I&#39;ve           essentially            used           <a href='http://www.rapidonline.com/Electronic-Components/SMD-Power-LEDs-6W-COB-Star-519319'>6W           COB
LEDs</a>,
which — according  to the specs given by their  manufacturers — are as
efficient  as 120lm/W  or 108lm/W,  depending on  if you  prefer white
light or  warm white  light. I gave  a try  to more a  classic (though
high-power)  LED before:  <a href='http://www.rapidonline.com/Electronic-Components/Power-LED-Modules-9x-1W-White-and-Warm-White-502683'>9  pieces of  1W  LEDs put  together on  an
aluminium
disc</a>. Well,
I switched  to COB LEDs for three  reasons. The first one  is that COB
LEDs are more energy-efficient.  The second one is that the voltage of
the COB  LEDs that I use is  higher (19V instead of  10V), which means
that for a  given wattage, the current intensity  (amperage) is lower,
and  that means  less chance  for the  wires to  heat...  (I&#39;m  not an
electronician nor  a physisist, please  correct me if I&#39;m  wrong.) And
the third one is  that COB LEDs are very compact. The  &quot;9 pieces of 1W
LEDs on a  disc&quot; is really big: the diameter is  88mm. The drawback is
that the COB LEDs that I use are only available in the 6500K and 3000K
color  temperatures, whereas the  other ones  are available  in 6500K,
4000K, 3000K and 2500K; 400K being my favourite.</p>
<h4 id="Powersupplyunits"> Power supply units</h4>
<p>It&#39;s not that  easy to provide electrical power  to LEDs... because we
need a  potentially quite  high amperage, the  right voltage,  and the
latter has to  be very stable (or at least never  reach a higher value
than the expected  one, otherwise the LEDs burn  and die quite easily,
and we  don&#39;t want to kill  some hardware that&#39;s supposed  to last ten
and up to thirty years).</p>
<p>I     recommend    <a href='http://www.rapidonline.com/Electrical-Power/36w-Volt-Adjustable-Multi-Output-Psu-eup-85-2908'>this    power     supply    unit     (PSU)    from
Rapid</a>
if you&#39;re  powering at most 30  watts of LEDs  at a voltage of  24V or
less for three  reasons: it seems to  me so far that it&#39;s  a very good
quality PSU, the voltage is well  regulated, it does provide up to 30W
without  complaining  or  heating  up,  it switches  on  very  quickly
(virtually instantaneously). I have used 2 of them for about 6 months.
(I haven&#39;t  tried to make it  work at 36W because  it would supposedly
diminish its lifespan.)</p>
<p>Well, that 36W PSU is  currently (early October 2013)  out of stock,
and since I visited  (randomly) a  Maplin store  and saw 
<a href='http://www.maplin.co.uk/maplin-120w-auto-voltage-universal-laptop-power-supply-with-usb-charging-531311'>this 120W  laptop power supply
unit</a> for less than £40,
I bought two of them to give  them a shot. They are a lot cheaper than
the 36W PSU I&#39;ve been using so far, if we compare the price-over-power
ratio.  Well,  the voltage  they deliver seems  okay: according  to my
cheap multimeter,  so it&#39;s not really the  most reliable measurement,
they deliver 19.2V when using a  19V head. The main drawback of this adaptor
is that  it takes  time to &quot;boot&quot;!   It&#39;s not  really a problem  for a
laptop, but for a lighting system,  having to wait 5 full seconds 
just seems  like forever. So it means that  if I want instantaneous
light-on feature, I need a switch  between the PSU and the LED instead
of between the wall plug and  the PSU. Well, in practice, I think I&#39;ll
simply wait 5  seconds, because I&#39;ll only use them when  I want a very
very bright light, since I  already have 2 LED-based lighting devices
powered by those 36W PSUs that provide power instantaneously.</p>
<p>The other drawback is that it&#39;s made to work with (existing) laptops
and they provide one connector per model (i.e., shape of the head and
voltage), so you can&#39;t use any connector and then asume you&#39;ll be able
to select the voltage: here, each head has a given associated voltage.</p>
<h4 id="Heat"> Heat!</h4>
<p>One of the biggest (potential) problem  with COB LEDs is that, as they
are  very powerful and  very tiny,  you&#39;re supposed  to stick  them on
something that can dissipate the heat that they produce. What I learnt
from that is that iron is  a very very slow heat conductor compared to
aluminium.               I&#39;m              using             <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B002HMQE86/'>aluminium
rulers</a>   because   it&#39;s   the
cheapest flat thing made of  aluminium that I could find.  Three rules
very easily dissipate  the heat produced by 4  LEDs.  I tried tripling
the density  of LEDs... It was not  a good idea, as  the rulers become
hot quite rapidly: within a few  minutes, they reach close to 50°C. So
with 4 LEDs per ruler, active fan cooling may dissipate the heat.</p>
<h4 id="StickingCOBLEDs"> Sticking COB LEDs</h4>
<p>To    stick   LEDs,    I   used    some   <a href='http://www.akasa.com.tw/update.php?tpl=product/product.detail.tpl&amp;type=Accessories&amp;type_sub=Thermal%20Interface&amp;model=AK-TT12-80'>akasa    thermal   adhesive
tape</a> that I bought on
Amazon, and it works pretty well.</p>
<h4 id="Theworstpart"> The worst part...</h4>
<p>... is obviously, to me, the soldering part. It&#39;s quite hard to solder
those COB LEDs because the contact spots are very small, so it takes
a tremendous amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="Overall"> Overall</h3>
<h4 id="Whybrightlightisimportant"> Why bright light is important...</h4>
<p>I feel  that it&#39;s important to  me to face (very)  bright light during
the day, and  it&#39;s best if it comes directly  from the sun. Apparently
(although I&#39;m not  a hundred percent sure) it&#39;s  actually important to
be exposed to (very) bright light at least 30 minutes a day.</p>
<p>So, instead of using a very expensive 
<a href='https://www.google.com/search?SAD+light'>S.A.D.  light</a> 
to prevent potential
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder'>seasonal affective disorder</a>,
well, I&#39;m using very bright state-of-the-art LEDs to light up my home. :-)</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion"> Conclusion</h4>
<p>LEDs are awesome because they need very little space compared to other
light-emitting devices.</p>
<p>As they&#39;re very energy-efficient, using them for indirect lighting
doesn&#39;t consume too much electricity.</p>
<p>They can last up to 10 or 30 years if they&#39;re taken well care of.
So once you make them, you don&#39;t need to worry about them for a while...
Well, I&#39;m not sure the power supply units can last that many years,
but it&#39;s not the hard part to change.</p>
<p>If    you     live    in    Cambridge    (UK),     you    could    use
<a href='http://makespace.org'>Makespace</a>  to build  your own  LED-based super
bright and/or  super smart lighting system. Well,  given my low-budget
when I  started building those LED-based lighting  systems, I couldn&#39;t
afford Makespace membership, so I kind of have all I need to handcraft
at home.</p>
<h5 id="Pictures"> Pictures</h5>
<p>4 COB LEDs on 3 aluminium  rulers, in parallel.  The 3 aluminum rulers
are  stuck  together using  aluminium  tape,  which  has good  thermal
conductivity, reflects light not too badly and is not too expensive.</p>
