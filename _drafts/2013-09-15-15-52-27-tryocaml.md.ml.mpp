This works:
- initiate a fresh opam 
- opam switch 4.00.1
- opam install tryocaml # -----> this is weird because nothing interesting seems to be installed in .opam except the dependencies, which are somehow what is most important...

and then,
tar xzf ~/.opam/archives/tryocaml.0.2.2+opam.tar.gz
cd tryocaml.0.2.2
./configure
make

So I think I'll stick to that. Before, when it didn't work, I was trying to install what's in https://github.com/OCamlPro/tryocaml and followed the instructions on https://github.com/OCamlPro/tryocaml#try-it. And I suspect the actual error being the fact that it tried to apply some patch to a version of the ocaml compiler that was not present (and it didn't go fetch it by itself, or maybe it did and failedâ€¦) Also, the fact that opam creates 3 empty directories (when "opam install tryocaml") is very disturbing!

```
$ find .opam -iname tryocaml|xargs ls -l
.opam/4.00.1/doc/tryocaml:
total 0

.opam/4.00.1/lib/tryocaml:
total 0

.opam/4.00.1/share/tryocaml:
total 0
```

Anyways, now I believe I have means to customise a tryocaml, which is (for now) what really matters.
